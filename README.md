# Breast-Cancer-Detection-SVM

- Breast Cancer Detection using Support Vector Machine
- This problem falls under the Machine Learning classification problem.

# About Cancer

- Tumor can be divided into Three Stage or Three Parts
> benign [ not cancerous ]
> pre-malignant [ pre-cancerous ]
> malignant [ cancerous ]

- Since this build a model that can classify a breast cancer tumor using two training classification:
> 1= Malignant (Cancerous) - Present
> 0= Benign (Not Cancerous) -Absent

# Libraries Used

- Numpy: To work with Matrix
- Pandas: To work with Dataset
- Matplotlib : To visualize Data
- Seaborn: To visualize Data
- Sklearn: To Load Dataset, Create matrix, train model, test model

# Installation

- Install necessary modules using pip
- ``` pip install requirement.txt```
